Yesterday, we was planning to go for a picnic but the weather become really bad. 
The rain start early in the morning and continued throughout the day. 
My friends were very disappointing because they had prepared so many stuffs like sandwiches, juice, and snacks. 
I tried to convince them to come to my house instead, but nobody was in a mood to agree. Everyone return home feeling bad about the cancelation of our plan.
